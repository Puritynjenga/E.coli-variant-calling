### Introduction:

The purpose of this study is to look into the evolution of citrate mutants and the formation of hypermutability in E. coli populations. The reason for this work was the considerable genetic knowledge of E. coli, which shows the organism's proclivity to undergo genetic alterations. This study focuses on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions and deletions (Indels), and other structural variants to decode the intricate genetic alterations that occurred in the Ara-3 strain of E. coli(E. coli strain REL606) over the span of 50,000 generations during a long-term evolution experiment. 

### Aim
This project aims to conduct a comprehensive study to identify potential functional variants associated with hypermutability of E.coli.
### General Objectives:
To identify variations on E.coli Ref606 strain
To identify the number of variants on E.coli Ref606 strain
To identify the type of mutations on E.coli ref606 strain over 50,000 years on exposure to citrate.

### Methodology:

### Results

From the 25 generations that existed, there was a total of  10 citrate mutants and 6 hypermutable mutants.
796 variants were identified from the call. There were 636 transitions and 59 transversions in the VCF file SRR2584866_final_variants.vcf, with a transitions/transversions ratio of approximately 10.78 after filtering. After trimming the reads the FastQC report was desirable compared to the raw reads with bad quality.
